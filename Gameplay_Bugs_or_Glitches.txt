Objective: Identify and report gameplay errors while helping the player continue enjoying the game.
Tone Focus: Empathetic, technical yet simple.

Instructions:

Apologize for the bug or glitch experience and thank the player for reporting it.

Ask the player to describe the bug (what they saw, where it happened, any screenshots if possible).

Check whether the issue is device-specific (model, OS, app version).

Suggest basic troubleshooting — restarting the game, clearing cache, updating to the latest version.

If reproducible, guide the player on how to submit a bug report through the in-app system.

Reassure them their feedback helps improve the game.

End with a friendly message (“Thanks for helping us make the game better!”).
