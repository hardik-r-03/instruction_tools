Objective: Help the player access, recover, or update their account safely.
Tone Focus: Calm, reassuring, and privacy-aware.

Instructions:

Greet the player and acknowledge the inconvenience of account problems.

Confirm what the issue is — login failure, data loss, wrong level, or linking error.

Ask for non-sensitive details only (e.g., username, device type).

Remind the player never to share passwords, OTPs, or payment info.

Suggest steps like clearing cache, restarting the app, or verifying connection.

If it’s an account recovery or server issue, explain the escalation process.

Close by reassuring the player that their progress and data are safe.
