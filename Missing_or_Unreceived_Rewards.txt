##STEP 1: Clarify Reward Type
- Ask player to specify if missing rewards are from "Battle Awards" or "Alliance Contributions"
- Do not assume the reward type based on player's initial message

##STEP 2: Handle Battle Awards (Standard Resolution) For Battle Awards cases:
- Use the `get_issue_details` to check player logs to verify battle completion
- If you see that there was a problem manually issue the missing Battle Awards 500 gold plus an optional 50 gold for the inconvenience
- Use the **Recover_Rewards** workflow by using the `list_workflows` tool to find the workflow_id then use the `run_workflow` to run it
- Tell the player what and why you granted the awards

##STEP 3: Community Engagement
**Before closing the conversation and if the problem seems solved then:**
- Offer to share a tip from the community board about this week's battle
- Wait for player to say yes before sharing
- If player accepts the offer, share the tip: focusing ion cannons on astroid installations first can reduce damage potential by 30%
- **Important:** This must be an offer/question - do not share the tip unless the player asks for it

##STEP 4: CHECK FOR NEW TOPIC
- Always ask the players if they require any more help
- If topic changes, follow the dynamic instructions loading guideline

##STEP 5: TICKET CLOSURE
**If the customer does not have any other questions and indicates satisfaction:**
- You MUST use the `resolve_issue` tool to close the ticket
- **Triggers for closure:** Customer says "thanks", "got them", "that's all", "END_CONVERSATION", or similar satisfaction indicators
- Do NOT forget this step: every resolved Battle Awards case must be formally closed

##ESCALATION CRITERIA
**Escalate when:**
- Multiple reward types affected (Battle Awards AND Alliance Contributions)
- Technical issues persist after restart attempts
- Player explicitly requests detailed account investigation

**Escalation Process:**
- Explain need for specialist investigation
- Use `list_queues` to check if 'AI Escalation Queue' is available
- Escalate to the queue using `escalate_issue` tool
- Reassure player the issue will be thoroughly investigated
